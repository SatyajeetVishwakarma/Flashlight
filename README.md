_The missing Spotlight plugin system_

_Das fehlende Plugin-System f√ºr Spotlight._

Flashlight is an **unofficial Spotlight API** that allows you to programmatically process queries and add additional results. It's *very rough right now,* and a *horrendous hack*, but a fun proof of concept.

_Have an idea for a plugin?_ [Suggest it](http://flashlight.nateparrott.com/ideas)

**Installation**

Clone and build using Xcode, or [download Flashlight.app from _releases_](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/releases).

## Writing Plugins

**Start with the [tutorial on writing plugins](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).**

## How it works

The `Flashlight.app` Xcode target is a fork of [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL) (which is designed to allow loading runtime injection of plugins into arbitrary apps) that's been modified to load a single plugin (stored inside its own bundle, rather than an external directory) into the Spotlight process. It should be able to coexist with EasySIMBL if you use it.

The SIMBL plugin that's loaded into Spotlight, `SpotlightSIMBL.bundle`, patches Spotlight to add a new subclass of `SPQuery`, the internal class used to fetch results from different sources. It runs a bundled Python script, which uses [commanding](https://github.com/nate-parrott/commanding) to parse queries and determine their intents and parameters, then invokes the appropriate plugin's `plugin.py` script and presents the results using a custom subclass of `SPResult`.

Since [I'm not sure how to subclass classes that aren't available at link time](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26704130/subclass-objective-c-class-without-linking-with-the-superclass), subclasses of Spotlight internal classes are made at runtime using [Mike Ash's instructions and helper code](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-11-19-creating-classes-at-runtime-for-fun-and-profit.html).

The Spotlight plugin is gated to run only on versions `911-916` (Yosemite GM through 10.10.2 seed). If a new version of Spotlight comes out, you can manually edit `SpotlightSIMBL/SpotlightSIMBL/Info.plist` key `SIMBLTargetApplications.MaxBundleVersion`, restarts Spotlight, verify everything works, and then submit a pull request.
